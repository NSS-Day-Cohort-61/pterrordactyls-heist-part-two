# Heist ðŸ’°
## Create a crew to rob a bank. 

This project was to practice using interfaces and inheritance among classes. 

We developed an application that creates a crew to rob a bank. 
- The crew was formed by the creation of lists, where the player can indicate the robber's specs. 
- Once the creation of the crew is made, you can form a roladex of robbers to actually rob the bank.
- The roladex will end once the money runs out, thus it depends on the cut each robber requires.
- To see if the robbery is successful, it will loop through the bank's properties (which are randomly assigned) to determine if the new bank is secure.
- If the robbery, fails it will call out the team that didn't have what it takes.
- We also add some fun additions like: weapons that are randomly assigned based on role and the location the crew member will escape to if they are successful in the heist.
